Still mostly under construction. This is a practice project for improvement purposes.

Blockchain and MinHash based order resolution

Using common randomness to ensure fair ordering mechanisms in order resolution of distributed systems is an idea used in [ALGORAND](https://www.algorand.com/) and the [Helix](https://www.orbs.com/) protocol.
Here I model a blockchain structure from scratch for practice purposes using the Correlated Sampling approach from Helix as the consensus mechanism.
