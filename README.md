This is a practice project to keep my brain busy while looking for a job.

Fair Object Ordering for Distributed systems(FOOD) based on Blockchain and Correlated Sampling concepts.

Using common randomness to ensure fair ordering mechanisms in order resolution of distributed systems is an idea used in [ALGORAND](https://www.algorand.com/) and the [Helix](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/helix-consensus-whitepaper/) protocol.
Here I model a blockchain structure from scratch for using the [Correlated Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01041) approach from [Helix](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/helix-consensus-whitepaper/) as the consensus mechanism.

Essentially this is just a simplified version of [Helix](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/helix-consensus-whitepaper/).
