This is a practice project to keep my brain busy while looking for a job.

Fair Object Ordering for Distributed systems(FOOD) based on Blockchain and Correlated Sampling concepts.

Using common randomness to ensure fair ordering mechanisms in order resolution of distributed systems is an idea used in [ALGORAND](https://www.algorand.com/) and the [Helix](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/helix-consensus-whitepaper/) protocol.
Here I model a blockchain structure from scratch using the [Correlated Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01041) approach from [Helix](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/helix-consensus-whitepaper/) as the ordering mechanism and PBFT as the consensus mechanism.

Essentially this is going to be just a simplified version of [Helix](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/helix-consensus-whitepaper/).

Since I'm building this from scratch there are probably mistakes made here and there that I will get rid of as I develop the project.
